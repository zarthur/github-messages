github-messages
===============
Represent short (24 or less characters) messages with a 3x3 font and display
them in the github activity chart.

This might be timezone dependent; so while it might look correct
to you, it could look weird to someone in a different timezone.


## How to use
First, create a new GitHub account (don't want existing commit history
interfering with the message) and a new repo.  Next, either add your usual user
as a collaborator or create new SSH keys for the new GitHub account.  Create a
config file with the correct settings.  Finally, run

    python3 github.py PATH_TO_CONFIG AWESOME_MESSAGE


## Requirements
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional)


## Examples
### matplotlib
Entering the following at the command line will generate a preview, as shown
below, in matplotlib.

    python3 preview.py This is a test message.

### GitHub
After setting up a GitHub account and updating the config file, running

    python3 github.py config.yml "This is a test message."

produced this:
